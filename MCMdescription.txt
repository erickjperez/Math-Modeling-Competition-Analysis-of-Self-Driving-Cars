	For the Math Modeling Competition, we were asked to find the affect self driving cars had on the Seattle area. We were given a data set consisting of hundreds of road segments, as long as the length, the number of lanes going each direction, and the total number of cars to use it at a time.
	My group took a spatial approach to the problem and looked to see how many cars could fit on that given stretch of road at a given time.
	We began by analyzing traffic hours and dispersing the amount of cars to a given time period on the freeway. After, we calculated how much cars needed in spacing when driving at 60mph. As the number of self driving cars continues to grow, the amount of space between cars would be smaller because of reduced reaction times. We also take into account that when cooperation of self driving cars occurred, the distance between the two would be minimal.
	As a result, the program outputs the percent likelihood traffic would occur at a given time on the stretches of road
